# Feature Specification: User Management Pages Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `001-user-management-pages`  
**Created**: 2025-09-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "user management pages implementation. use for reference @USER_MANAGEMENT_API_MANUAL.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Complete user management system for ASUBK Financial Management System
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: ADMIN users, system administrators
   ‚Üí Actions: create, read, update, delete, search, filter users
   ‚Üí Data: users, roles, permissions, authentication
   ‚Üí Constraints: role-based access, API validation, multilingual support
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All requirements clearly defined in provided API manual
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flows documented for admin user management
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable against API manual specifications
6. Identify Key Entities (users, roles, permissions)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec ready for implementation
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator with ADMIN role, I need comprehensive user management capabilities to create, view, edit, delete, and manage users in the ASUBK Financial Management System. I must be able to search and filter users, assign roles and permissions, manage user status (active/inactive), and ensure proper access controls are maintained across the 6-role system (ADMIN, CREDIT_MANAGER, CREDIT_ANALYST, DECISION_MAKER, COMMISSION_MEMBER, USER).

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am an authenticated ADMIN user, **When** I navigate to user management, **Then** I see a paginated list of all users with their basic information (name, username, email, roles, status, last login)

2. **Given** I am on the user list page, **When** I click "Create New User", **Then** I see a comprehensive form with all required fields (username, email, password, first name, last name, roles) and optional fields (phone, department)

3. **Given** I am creating a new user, **When** I enter a username, **Then** the system validates username availability in real-time using the API

4. **Given** I am creating a new user, **When** I enter an email address, **Then** the system validates email availability in real-time using the API

5. **Given** I am viewing the user list, **When** I use the search functionality, **Then** the system searches across username, email, firstName, and lastName fields

6. **Given** I am viewing a user's details, **When** I click edit, **Then** I can modify all user information except username (which should be immutable)

7. **Given** I am managing users, **When** I attempt to delete a user, **Then** I receive a confirmation dialog with clear warning about data loss

8. **Given** I am viewing user details, **When** I look at user information, **Then** I see complete user profile including roles, permissions, creation date, last login, and activity history

### Edge Cases
- What happens when I try to create a user with duplicate username or email?
- How does system handle validation errors during user creation/update?
- What happens when I try to delete the last ADMIN user?
- How does the system handle users with no roles assigned?
- What happens when API is unavailable during user operations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide paginated user list with sorting and filtering capabilities
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow ADMIN users to create new users with comprehensive validation
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate username uniqueness in real-time during user creation/editing
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate email uniqueness in real-time during user creation/editing
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow ADMIN users to view complete user details including roles and activity history
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow ADMIN users to edit user information with proper validation
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow ADMIN users to delete users with confirmation dialog
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide search functionality across multiple user fields (username, email, names)
- **FR-009**: System MUST support advanced filtering by role, status, department, and date ranges
- **FR-010**: System MUST integrate with role and permission management system
- **FR-011**: System MUST support user status management (active/inactive/suspended)
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate all input according to API specification requirements
- **FR-013**: System MUST display proper error messages in current user language (KG/RU/EN)
- **FR-014**: System MUST prevent unauthorized access to user management functions
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide responsive design for mobile and desktop access
- **FR-016**: System MUST maintain user session security during all operations
- **FR-017**: System MUST log all user management activities for audit purposes
- **FR-018**: System MUST handle API errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- **FR-019**: System MUST support bulk operations for user status updates
- **FR-020**: System MUST export user data for reporting purposes

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents system users with attributes: id (UUID), username, email, password, firstName, lastName, phone, department, roles, status, enabled flag, creation/update timestamps, last login
- **Role**: Represents user roles (ADMIN, CREDIT_MANAGER, CREDIT_ANALYST, DECISION_MAKER, COMMISSION_MEMBER, USER) with associated permissions
- **Permission**: Represents granular system permissions that can be assigned to roles
- **UserActivity**: Represents audit log of user actions and system changes
- **UserSession**: Represents active user sessions and authentication state
