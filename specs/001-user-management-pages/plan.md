# Implementation Plan: User Management Pages Implementation

**Branch**: `001-user-management-pages` | **Date**: 2025-09-12 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-user-management-pages/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Implementation of comprehensive user management pages for ASUBK Financial Management System. Provides ADMIN users with full CRUD capabilities for user accounts, including real-time validation, role management, search/filtering, and multilingual support across the 6-role system (ADMIN, CREDIT_MANAGER, CREDIT_ANALYST, DECISION_MAKER, COMMISSION_MEMBER, USER).

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript with React 18+ and Vite build tool  
**Primary Dependencies**: shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS v4, Redux Toolkit with RTK Query, React Hook Form, Zod validation, React Router v6  
**Storage**: Backend API integration via RTK Query (Spring Boot 3.2 backend with database)  
**Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E testing  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (desktop and mobile responsive)
**Project Type**: web - frontend React application with backend API integration  
**Performance Goals**: <200ms API response times, <3s page load, real-time validation feedback  
**Constraints**: Role-based access control, JWT authentication, multilingual support (KG/RU/EN), responsive design  
**Scale/Scope**: Multiple user management pages, 20+ functional requirements, 6-role permission system

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (subi-frontend React app, integrates with existing backend)
- Using framework directly? (Yes - React, Redux Toolkit, shadcn/ui components used directly)
- Single data model? (Yes - using existing TypeScript interfaces, RTK Query handles serialization)
- Avoiding patterns? (Yes - using React hooks and RTK Query directly, no unnecessary abstraction layers)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? (N/A - Frontend React components, not libraries. Using existing component library structure)
- Libraries listed: shadcn/ui (UI components), RTK Query (API client), React Hook Form (forms), Zod (validation)
- CLI per library: (N/A - Web frontend application, not CLI tooling)
- Library docs: (N/A - Component documentation via TypeScript types and existing patterns)

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? (YES - Tests will be written first for each component)
- Git commits show tests before implementation? (YES - Test commits before implementation commits)
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? (YES - API contracts exist, will add integration tests, E2E with Playwright, unit tests)
- Real dependencies used? (YES - API integration tests with actual backend, mock only when necessary)
- Integration tests for: new pages, form validation, API integration, role-based access
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase (ACKNOWLEDGED)

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? (YES - Using existing error handling in RTK Query, console logging for debugging)
- Frontend logs → backend? (YES - RTK Query errors propagated to backend logging via API calls)
- Error context sufficient? (YES - User-friendly error messages with i18n support, detailed dev logging)

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? (Part of main application version in package.json)
- BUILD increments on every change? (Handled by CI/CD pipeline with git commits)
- Breaking changes handled? (API compatibility maintained, gradual rollout of UI changes)

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - This is a React frontend integrating with Spring Boot backend

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh [claude|gemini|copilot]` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md)
- API contract (user-api-contract.yaml) → contract validation tests [P]
- Data model entities → TypeScript interface validation [P]
- User story scenarios → integration test tasks
- Component implementation tasks following TDD approach
- E2E test tasks based on quickstart validation scenarios

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- Dependency order: 
  1. Contract tests (validate API integration)
  2. Component tests (validate UI behavior)
  3. Integration tests (validate user workflows)
  4. Implementation tasks (make tests pass)
  5. E2E tests (validate complete user journeys)
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files/components)

**Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Contract Validation Tasks [P]**: Test API endpoints match OpenAPI spec
2. **Component Test Tasks**: Create failing tests for each UI component
3. **User List Enhancement Tasks**: Improve existing UserListPage with advanced features
4. **User Form Enhancement Tasks**: Enhance UserAddEditPage with real-time validation
5. **User Detail Enhancement Tasks**: Improve UserDetailPage with activity timeline
6. **Bulk Operations Tasks**: New bulk operations toolbar and functionality
7. **Integration Test Tasks**: Test complete user workflows
8. **E2E Test Tasks**: Playwright tests for critical user journeys

**Implementation Focus**:
- Enhance existing pages rather than rewrite from scratch
- Build reusable components (DataTable, BulkActionsToolbar, ActivityTimeline)
- Integrate with existing RTK Query userApi
- Follow established patterns (shadcn/ui, React Hook Form, Zod)

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
