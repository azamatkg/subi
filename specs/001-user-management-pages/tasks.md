## Notes
- **[P] tasks** target different files with no dependencies - safe for parallel execution
- **Sequential tasks** modify shared files or have direct dependencies  
- **TDD Enforcement**: Verify all tests fail before implementing features
- **Enhancement Focus**: Building on existing pages rather than complete rewrites
- **Commit Strategy**: Commit after each completed task for clear progress tracking
- **Performance Target**: <200ms API responses, <3s page loads, smooth real-time validation
